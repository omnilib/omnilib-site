Contributing
============

We welcome everyone to join us in building and improving Omnilib projects.
Our only requirement is that you follow the :ref:`code-of-conduct` and be
respectful of projects' and their maintainers' goals.

We try to keep friction to a minimum for contributers; there are no license
agreements to sign, and all projects have contributers guides covering how
to set up your local development environment. Pull requests should trigger
CI jobs to validate your contribution against the project's test suite,
type checker, and any linters, so you can get immediate, technical feedback.

If you would like to contribute, but aren't sure where to start, take a look
at the list of :ref:`Omnilib projects <projects>` to see if any of them seem
interesting to you. Follow the links to their Github repositories, and look
for open issues, ideally ones tagged with "good first issue" or "hacktoberfest".
These issues should be relatively small in size, or require less knowledge of
the project to fix the bug or add the new feature. If you have any questions
or need more direction from a maintainer, feel free to comment on the issue.
